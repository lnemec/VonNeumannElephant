# The Noisy Elephant
The relation between noise and dataset size in machine learning regression

## Summary
This is the code base related to the medium Blog article "The Noisy Elephant".
In the reporsitory, we will explore the relation between noise and dataset size
in machine learning regression. We will see, how increasing data quality or to
be more specific reducing the noise in your dataset will allow developing reliable
machine learning regression models with small datasets using Gaussian processes.
In the following, we introduce the dataset first. Second, we define the simulated
noise that we will add to the data. Third, we will explore the influence of dataset
size and noise on the accuracy of the regression model.

## Julia
If you like to run the code, you need to install [Julia](https://julialang.org). A
good introduction [How to install Julia and Pluto | 18.S191 MIT Fall 2020](https://youtu.be/OOjKEgbt8AI) and a
written version of the tutorial can be found [here](https://computationalthinking.mit.edu/Fall20/installation/)
